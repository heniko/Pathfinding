# Project definition

Project aims to implement and visualize different pathfinding algorithms. Data structures needed by the pathfinding algorithms will also be implemented. Programming language used for this project will be Java.

## Algorithms and data structures

Pathfinding algorithms:
* Dijkstra
* A*
* Jump point search (Probably)

Data structures:
* Priority queue
