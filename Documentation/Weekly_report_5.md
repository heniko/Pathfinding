# Week 5

## Progress report

* PriorityQueue replaced with my own implementation NodeHeap
* Java Math replaced with my own implementation Mathematics (Math.sqrt still used since Mathematics.sqrt was shown to be less accurate and a lot slower in performance testing)
* Reading Moving AI Lab maps is possible
* Performance testing of pathfinding algortihms is pretty much done
* Testing document has results of the performance tests

## Goals for the next week

At this point main parts of the program are ready. All the needed data structures and algorithms are replaced with my own implementations. Performance testing of pathfinding algorithms is done. Code should be pretty well documented. Testing document is at good stage.

The main goal for next week is probably to work on finishing documentation.
