# Week 4

## Progress report

* Jump point search finished
* Package structure changed
* Some shared methods and methods not specific to one pathfinding algorithm moved to abstract class
* LinkedList and ArrayList replaced by own List implementation

## Goals for the next week

A*, JPS, GUI and List should be mostly finished. The most time consuming things left are implementing my own heap and performance testing. Next week I will prioritize finishing main parts of the program (heap mostly) and then the rest of the time will be spent on implementing performance tester. For comparing the performance of different pathfinding algorithms I will probably use some [Moving AI Lab street maps](https://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/street/index.html).
