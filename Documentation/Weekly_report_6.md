# Week 6

## Progress report

* User guide added
* Tested bug/optimisation fix for problem mentioned in peer review 1 (Performance testing shows it wasn't too important to fix so solution is commented out)

## Goals for next week

There aren't any big goals left. Documentation still needs some work (Mostly implmentation document). Also Github release should be added.
