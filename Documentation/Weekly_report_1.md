# Week 1

## Progress report

* Chose the topic and started familiarizing myself with it
* Created Github repository for the project
* Created Gradle project
* Definition document

## Goals for the next week

Finding a way to visualize algorithms that I am happy with. After that the best way to get the project started would probably be implementing UI and pathfinding algorithms using already existing data structures. Ideally I should have working UI and some pathfinding algorithms ready next week.
