# Testing document

## Unit testing

Unit testing report can be generated by running following commands in file pathfinding:

```
gradle test
gradle jacocoTestReport
```

## Running performance tests

Performance tests can be run with command:

```
gradle run --args='test'
```

Running performance tests will take minutes. Results are printed as matrix for markdown-file.

## Pathfinding algorithm comparison



## Math.sqrt() and Mathematics.sqrt() comparison

My own implementation Mathematics.sqrt was compared to Java Math.sqrt. 100 * 1 million square root operations were performed on each implementation.

| Implementation | Average time (ms) | Standard deviation (ms) | Max time (ms) | Min time (ms) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Math.sqrt() | 17.2029411500 | 0.3667132035 | 20.0897420000 | 17.0854400000 |
| Mathematics.sqrt() | 459.9529044900 | 5.0823893244 | 490.9576530000 | 450.5102220000 |

My implementation seems to be pretty slow compared to Java implementation which makes sense since Math.sqrt is O(1) and my implementation is O(log(n)). My implementation also only approximates square root untill error is under 0.0000001. For these reasons Math.sqrt() will be used instead of Mathematics.sqrt().
