# Week 3

## Progress report

* GUI should now be pretty close to being finished
* A* and different heuristics
* Jump point search
* Checkstyle added

## Goals for the next week

JPS was pretty late addition and still needs some work. After finishing JPS I will start replacing data structures with my own ones. Code needs some cleaning too and after data structures/before code review would probably be good time for that.
